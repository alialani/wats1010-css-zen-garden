#Design Concepts

This website is redesigned website based on the CSS Zen Garden HTML Script which many designed have been driven from.
I'm trying to combine between designs and group thoughts and ideas I've seen drom different sites to come up with new
ideas that might help to come up with new inovating design and an eye catching website. The redesign might change after
implementing it and see how it looks like to follow the spiral design approach.

I'm hoping that my design will be an eye catching, good looking and accessible to the user as I'm trying to keep it single 
and easy to understand. I've already started with i t and subbmited it to the github so please you feedbacks are hight valuable
